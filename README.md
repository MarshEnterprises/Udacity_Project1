# Results 
Q1: How important are open source tools to Stack Overflow users?

Top 2 environments are MS Visual Studio Code and MS Visual Studio, suggesting that most users are pro-propitiatory, however there are much larger number of open source environments to choose from, and in total, most use open source. It must be said that only ~one quarter use linux and ~one eighth contribute to open source projects more than once per month. Most users think that open source software is on par with or better than proprietary software.

In general, Stack Overflow users see the value in OSS, but not many contribute to it.

Q2: What background do Stack Overflow users have?

Most are men, between 25 and 30 years in age. Three quarters have Bachelor or Master level tertiary education. Only few do not have tertiary education. Three quarters also have a major in a tech-related field. By far most Stack Overflow users come from the USA, followed by India, Germany, the UK and Canada.

Q3: What are the trends for Stack Overflow user's salaries?

As might be expected, the number of Stack Overflow users decreases with increasing earnings. A salary of USD1000000/year and USD2000000/year seem to be standard salaries for very high earners. Even though there are much fewer female than male Stack Overflow users, their salary distribution seems similar, but women do earn less on the very high end of the salary spectrum. In general one earns more with increasing age, but the older, the larger the spread of salaries, suggesting that ones skill and dedication in ones career matter. Salaries in English-speaking countries are the highest, while India and Brazil have the lowest salaries. Surprisingly, the median salary of users with a tech-related major is lower than median salary of users with humanities major. No real differences in earnings by operating system used.
